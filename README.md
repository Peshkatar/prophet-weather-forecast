Introduction

The aim of the project is to explore and report on the application of machine learning to a real-world challenge. The project should be relevant (with respect to society, science, or industry) and significant (in that it should take an average computer science Master's student more than 107 hours to complete).

The work should be complete (the report and attached files must cover the complete project, with all intermediary steps from idea to conclusion) and correct (all design choices must be carefully motivated, and all results must be verified). The following concepts must be discussed and motivated for all projects, but the balance between them may vary based on the type of project conducted:

the machine learning task to solve and the identified learning problem
the learning algorithm(s) parameter configurations pre-processing used
the evaluation procedure and measures (what and how to measure)
the experiment (its aim, design, execution, and limitations), analysis (how to interpret the results)
Grading

 The examiner will investigate the report and attached files to find out how well the following questions are addressed:

Is the challenge addressed relevant to science, society, or industry?
Do the challenge and the proposed solution require a significant effort?
Are the learning task and learning problem clearly defined, is the learning problem suitable for the task, and is the learning problem tractable and solvable?
Are the choices of the algorithm(s), pre-processing, parameter configuration, evaluation measure(s), and data logical and suitable based on the above?
Is the experiment design complete, correct, and appropriate for the studied problem and the proposed solution?
Is the analysis of the results correct, clear, and lucid?
Is the conclusion reasonable and logical based on the results? Is it profound or trivial?
Each aspect is scored 0 (FX) - 5 (A). The overall grading is based on a qualitative assessment but should reasonably be close to the average (but may not be, e.g., due to outliers). One or more FX aspects may lead to an overall grade of F.

Submission

Report:

Or talk to teachers to find out about important challenges in an area that interests you at BTH (e.g., computer science, health, mechanical engineering, software engineering, sustainability, etc.) and then develop a machine learning solution yourself to address the challenge.
